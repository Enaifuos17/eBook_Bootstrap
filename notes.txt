1 - Intro & Setup

- To use bootstrap,
    we can download the compiled CSS and JS folder
    or CDN or NPM to install it

- We will use the CDN method for now

- Bootstrap -> getting started -> download -> CDN via jsDelivr (copy)
-- then the CSS link will be in the top, and the JS link will be in the bottom
